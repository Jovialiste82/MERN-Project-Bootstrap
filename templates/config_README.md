# config/

## 1. Purpose

Centralizes configuration-related files, including environment variables, Docker Compose configurations, and other setup files.

## 2. Why Add It?

Ensures that all configuration settings are organized and easily accessible, promoting consistency across different environments and services.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Environment Files:** Store `.env` files for different environments (development, staging, production).
- **Docker Configurations:** Maintain Docker Compose files and Dockerfile configurations for various services.
- **Modular Configurations:** If configurations grow complex, consider subdirectories for specific services or environments.

## 4. Examples

- **.env.development**: Environment variables for the development environment.
- **compose-app.yaml**: Docker Compose configuration for application services.
- **docker/**: Contains individual Dockerfiles for client, server, and other services.
