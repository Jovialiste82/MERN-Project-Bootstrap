# shared/

## 1. Purpose

Hosts shared code and resources that are utilized across multiple parts of the application, such as the server and workers.

## 2. Why Add It?

Promotes the DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principle by centralizing reusable components, utilities, models, and constants.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Organization:** Categorize shared resources into subdirectories like `models/`, `utils/`, and `constants/`.
- **Reusability:** Ensure that shared code is generic and not tightly coupled to specific services.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear documentation for shared utilities and components to facilitate easy usage.

## 4. Examples

- **models/**: Shared database models used by both server and workers.
- **utils/**: Utility functions such as data validators or formatters.
- **constants/**: Common constants and enums used throughout the application.
