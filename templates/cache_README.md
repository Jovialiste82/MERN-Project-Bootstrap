# cache/

## 1. Purpose

Stores cached data to enhance application performance by reducing redundant data fetching or computations.

## 2. Why Add It?

Improves response times and reduces load on primary data sources by temporarily storing frequently accessed data.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Cache Invalidation:** Implement strategies to refresh or invalidate cached data to prevent stale information.
- **Security:** Ensure sensitive data is not inadvertently cached or is encrypted if necessary.
- **Monitoring:** Track cache usage and performance to optimize caching strategies.

## 4. Examples

- **Redis Cache:** Configuration files or scripts related to Redis caching.
- **In-Memory Cache:** Implementation files for in-memory caching mechanisms.
