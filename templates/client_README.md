# client/

## 1. Purpose

Houses the front-end React application, managing user interfaces, client-side logic, and interactions.

## 2. Why Add It?

Separates the front-end codebase from the back-end, promoting modularity and independent development.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Folder Structure:** Organize components, hooks, pages, and assets logically within the `src/` directory.
- **State Management:** Implement consistent state management strategies using tools like Redux or Context API.
- **Routing:** Utilize React Router for client-side navigation and routing.

## 4. Examples

- **src/components/**: Reusable React components.
- **src/pages/**: Page-level components corresponding to application routes.
- **src/assets/**: Static assets such as images, fonts, and stylesheets.
