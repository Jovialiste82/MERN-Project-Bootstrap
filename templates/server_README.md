# server/

## 1. Purpose

Contains the back-end Node.js/Express application responsible for handling API requests, business logic, and interactions with the database.

## 2. Why Add It?

Separates server-side logic from the client, promoting a clear distinction between front-end and back-end responsibilities.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Modular Structure:** Organize code into controllers, models, routes, services, and middlewares for maintainability.
- **Configuration Management:** Utilize the `config/` directory for environment-specific settings.
- **Error Handling:** Implement consistent error handling and logging mechanisms.

## 4. Examples

- **src/controllers/**: Contains controller functions handling API requests.
- **src/models/**: Defines database schemas and models.
- **src/routes/**: Sets up API endpoints and routes.
- **src/services/**: Contains business logic and service layer code.
- **src/middlewares/**: Implements middleware functions for request processing.
