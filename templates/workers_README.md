# workers/

## 1. Purpose

Contains background job processors or microservices responsible for handling asynchronous tasks, such as data processing, email sending, or scheduled jobs.

## 2. Why Add It?

Offloads time-consuming or resource-intensive tasks from the main server, improving application performance and responsiveness.

## 3. Recommendations

- **Isolation:** Keep worker processes isolated from the main server to ensure stability and scalability.
- **Communication:** Implement clear communication protocols between workers and the server, such as message queues or event emitters.
- **Monitoring:** Track worker performance and handle failures gracefully to maintain reliability.

## 4. Examples

- **src/jobs/**: Defines different types of background jobs (e.g., email sending, data aggregation).
- **src/services/**: Contains services that interact with external APIs or databases for job processing.
- **tests/**: Test suites for worker functionalities and job processing logic.
